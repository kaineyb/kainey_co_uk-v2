## Past

I've dabbled in programming since I was a youngster. It started with an Amstrad 464 where I started to play around with [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC).

In the late 90s, I only had internet access via my phone using [W.A.P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Application_Protocol), or the computers at my friends or school.

I started to learn [XHTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML), CSS and a bit of JavaScript. That evolved to PHP (of which I've mostly forgotten!) where I built a few sites using WordPress.

Updated my knowledge of HTML and CSS to their current forms of HTML5 and CSS3.

Learned Python, starting with [Automate the Boring Stuff by Al Swiegart](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) and then onto [Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/).

Augmented via [Mosh Hamedani's](https://codewithmosh.com/) Courses, [Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g) on Youtube. In 2022 I completed Harvard's [CS50x](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0) ([My Cert](https://certificates.cs50.io/2a97932a-bb33-4fc0-b949-836951297170.pdf?size=A4))

Then I focused more on JavaScript and TypeScript.

I've built a few projects, the public ones you can find under [Projects](/projects) or on my [GitHub](https://github.com/kaineyb).

## Present

Currently I am employed as a [Software Engineer](https://github.com/kaine-bruce-dmt) @ [Digital Media Technologies](https://digitalmedia.tech/) in Hertford, UK.
