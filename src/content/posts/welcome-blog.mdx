excerpt: "I've spent a bit of time, redesigning and writing the code for this site. It's written using Astro JS

I've tried to code it so that it's easy to maintain and not cobbled together, and Astro helps with that. I can write a blog post using markdown and focus on content. I can also add a JSX/TSX component straight into my Markdown, which is super cool!

I aim to write about Python, JavaScript, TypeScript and the myriad of libraries and frameworks out there.  Along with any hints or tips I find or use along the way.

You may also see the odd post about anything else I've started dabbling in.

Thanks for reading, and watch this space!
