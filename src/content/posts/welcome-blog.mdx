excerpt: "I've spent a bit of time (around 2 weeks), designing and writing the code for this site. It's probably the best flask site I've built up until now! Means I'll have to look at refactoring any other projects (currently hosted or just in development). I've tried to code it so that it's easy to maintain and not just cobbled together.

This is the first post of hopefully many. I do aim to write about python, the myriad of libraries out there and any hints or tips I find or use along the way. I've used Python for around 1 - 2 years solidly. I did start to learn it around 5 years ago, but that was the very basics.

You may also see the odd post about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL or anything else I've started dabbling in.

Thanks for reading and watch this space!
