I've spent a bit of time, redesigning and writing the code for this site. It's written using [Astro Js](https://astro.build/)

I've tried to code it so that it's easy to maintain and not just cobbled together, and Astro certainly helps with that. I can write a blog post using markdown, and I can just focus on content. I can also add a JSX/TSX component straight into my Markdown, which is super cool!

I aim to write about Python, JavaScript, TypeScript and the myriad of libraries and frameworks out there with any hints or tips I find or use along the way.

You may also see the odd post about anything else I've started dabbling in.

Thanks for reading and watch this space!

Kaine
