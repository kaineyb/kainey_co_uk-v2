## Intro

Most humans generally perceive a Delta E value of less than 0 as the same colour. Pantone swatches used by designers and printers for colour matching are produced by Pantone within a Delta E of 2.0. Read more about [colour difference](http://www.colorwiki.com/wiki/Delta_E:_The_Color_Difference)

This calculator returns a value of colour difference using the '00 or '76 Delta E formula.

## Project Outline

I created this module with the plan to test against a dataset supplied by the [University of Rochester](http://www2.ece.rochester.edu/~gsharma/ciede2000/). This was to make sure my code and maths worked as expected. I created code to create the tests needed from the dataset supplied.

Big thanks to Jamie Y for the maths help and guidance!

I chose Delta E 2000 because I've always liked the science behind colour and light; along with the fact I had worked in the print industry for 15 years. I started working on this in JavaScript years ago, but I found that [Bruce Lindbloom](http://www.brucelindbloom.com/index.html?ColorDifferenceCalc.html) had done the same on his site, so decided to see if I could do this in Python.

## Features

[![build passing](https://app.travis-ci.com/kaineyb/deltae.svg?branch=master)](https://app.travis-ci.com/kaineyb/deltae)

Built and tested using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) and [Travis CI](https://www.travis-ci.com/)

**Using:** Python with the builtin math module and testing using unittest.

**Features:**

- Colour Difference Calculator using the Delta E 2000 & 1976 formulas

## Addendum

It has come to my attention that the ColorMath Library for Python has a Delta E implementation (see [here](https://python-colormath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/delta_e.html)).
Yet as this was my first foray into building something myself in python. I am still going to keep this project up on PyPi. I am also not sure if they would pass the Rochester data-set, or if that is even the best benchmark.

## Installation (using pip)

```bash
> pip install deltae
```

## Example Usage

```py
import deltae

# Takes CIELAB values as a dictionary:
Lab1 = {'L': 50.00, 'a': 2.6772, 'b': -79.7751}
Lab2 = {'L': 50.00, 'a': 0.00, 'b': -82.7485}

# Get the DeltaE 1976 Formula of 2 Lab Values:
deltae.delta_e_1976(Lab1, Lab2)

# Get the DeltaE 2000 Formula of 2 Lab Values:
deltae.delta_e_2000(Lab1, Lab2)

```
