ESO Crow was created to help navigate in the [Elder Scrolls Online](https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/) (without using wayshrines).  
This can be quite handy when you're new to the game or just starting a new alt.

Deploys from Github using a cpanel.yml and custom deploy.sh to either the dev/staging [site](https://dev.esocrow.com) or the live site you're on now.
